Week: Week 7.

Learning Activities & Resources: Discussion about PHP setup and configurations on Visual Studio Code for the first 1/3 of the project.

Estimated Hours: Around an hour on us figuring out what to actually do since most works have to be done individually during practical 7 session.

Content Insights: Although we did the indiviual PHP configurations, we haven't done any configurations for the actual group project yet which worth the 1/3 of the assignment as of week 7 because; 
                  (1) Htet Arkar Win lost track of steps by steps instructions by the professor since he is a slow learner and some extra problems made it worse (explained in details in https://github.com/HtetArkarWin/weeklyentry.md/blob/main/week7_entry.md).   
                  (2) All of us are completely clueless about what to do since the professor's explaination are not clear and him not providing us with learning materials given from the actual Australia's university for some reasons made it so much worse.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: It is not just us 3 members of the team, even other members from different teams are having difficulty understanding what to even do. It is fine if it is just creating a website with PHP then present it in the final day but there are marking system where we have to do exactly as what was described, also we don't get the files or learning materials describing those marking outlines for this assignment 2. This first 1/3 of progresses is worth 10 points in 50 points project and we don't know what we have to do or submit for this 1/3. Next time, I hope the professor would explain us with a bit more patience because the situation right now is not good at all.
