Week: Week 8.

Learning Activities & Resources: Finishing 2/3 & 3/3 of progresses and thus, finishing the project. There are additional learning activities with the help of my classmates and online tutorials because I did not know what to, let alone how to do at first about almost everything for the assignment 2 / group project.

Estimated Hours: Took over 5 days. Everything including learning activities, tools & software configurations and communication with team members on discussion about the project.

Content Insights: In the first day when we had face-to-face stand up meeting, I had to divide the roles of progress tracking on trello and other writing roles like presentation script to other members of the team and then we take a picture of ourself to insert it in the project. After getting home and resting for a while, I had to research more about the project by asking friends I know in the class via online messaging and also via online guides like YouTube videos explaining about parts I don't understand which are unironically way more useful than the screenshots I took from practical sessions. Also the part 1/3 of the 1st version of the project which the professor refused to help me with got completely solved because I did further diging on learning materials given by Australian professor on GitHub, I found the codes I can use for that 1/3 of the project. Then I learnt the rest via online, then implement software configurations with the help of those content creators and completed the website building in over 3 days. I spent remaining 2 days on writing reports, rechecking trello board and preparing presentation video. Also this might be week 8 but we are actually having to work by considering that we were in week 9 because this CMS course was late by a whole week.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: The most stressful part about the whole thing is that we are 1 whole week late and we wasted last week because almost all of us from the class let alone our team were not clear about what to even do. We also don't even know the exact date and time of the deadline where the only thing we know is that the deadline is in week 10. My friend tried to ask the professor to delay the deadline to next week or just a few days is fine but again, he declined for some reason. Working on this assignment 2 of CP3402 Content Management System is my most frustrating and stressful experience during all my semisters of attending JCU not because the subject is hard but because of miscommunication between the professor and us students and there were even more to that.
